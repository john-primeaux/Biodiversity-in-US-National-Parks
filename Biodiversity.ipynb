This question can be answered by creating a new column called is_protected and includes any species that had a value other than No Intervention.

    "Like any study or experiment, there are always limitations. One of the biggest obstacles to the data is that it was only observations in the past 7 days. Having more data from a greater period of time would likely prove to change the conservation status over the course of time. Another limitation is the fact that only 4 of the Naitonal Parks had data collected. If Carlsbad Caverns and Mount Rushmore had been included, there would likely be a lot more bat species included in this study, which may have changed the analysis substantially. Taking into account the size of Yellowstone compared to the other parks studied, I believe it would provide substantially more observations, as well as a diverse set of species. "
